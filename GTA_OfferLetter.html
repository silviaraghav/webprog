  Dear {{student_name}},<br><br>

  Congratulations! You have been chosen to receive <strong>{{award_title}}</strong> for the academic year from <strong>{{application start and end date}}</strong>.</p>
  <h4 style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: -20px; margin-bottom:0;">Benefits of the Award:</h4>

  <p style= margin-top:0;><strong>Stipend:</strong> The monthly assistantship stipend is {{stipend details}}. Some students need to access financial aid to supplement their stipend. Your first paycheck will be issued at the end of the first month of the assistantship and the final one on the last day of the last month of your assistantship. </p>

  <p><strong>Tuition Waiver:</strong> You will also receive a tuition waiver so long as you (1) meet the minimum credit hour requirement described below; and (2) you successfully verify your lawful presence as defined by the University System of Georgia’s Board of Regents.  Receipt of a tuition waiver means that Georgia State University will cover tuition costs for you each semester you receive the tuition waiver (approximately $4,776 in-state or $15,108 out-of-state), and you will only be responsible for paying $37.50 each semester toward your tuition. Additionally, if you are in a program with differential tuition, the waiver does not cover the differential portion of the tuition cost. You will be responsible for covering this portion.</p>

  <p><strong>Health Insurance:</strong>All graduate students awarded a full tuition waiver as part of their fellowship are required to (1) enroll in Georgia State University’s Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) (see information below); or (2) show proof of health insurance by submitting via the waiver option at this site. For more information about the Affordable Care Act and alternatives to GSU’s health insurance plans, see: https://www.healthcare.gov/.  GSU’s SHIP is managed through United Healthcare.  Enrollment occurs in Fall semester and again for Spring and Summer semesters, combined.</p>

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: -20px;">Conditions of the Award:</h4>

  <p><strong>Hiring Process:</strong> If you have not previously served as a Graduate Assistant at GSU, you must complete a Graduate Assistant New Hire Packet before beginning the assistantship. You will receive an email request from onboarding@gsu.edu to initiate this paperwork. Please ensure that you do so promptly to ensure on time payment of your stipend.</p>

  <p><strong>Performance:</strong>Graduate assistantships and related benefits are conditioned upon meeting performance expectations and failure to do so may result in termination of the assistantship.</p>

  <p><strong>Minimum Credit Hours:</strong> The university requires that students receiving tuition waivers sign up for at least 12 credit hours, during the academic year and 9 credit hours in the summer semester.
